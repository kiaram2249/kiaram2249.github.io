            <h1 class="margin text-center">Freedom Project</h1>
            <p>This was a year long project and we had to make a website based on a topic of our choosing. As well we had to us all the things that we learnt such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and our tool that we pick.</p>
            <p>The topic that I pick to do was Criminology. I wanted to make a website about Criminology and the different types of Software and Hardware that they use.</p>
            <p>So that's what I did, I made a website that talk about Criminology and the different Hardware and Software that they use. I also included future technologies that I came up with as well some of my friends.</p>
            <p>Making this website was kind of hard because I had to find information about my topic and that took a while. As well I had to learn my tool, which was A-frame and A-frame was really hard to learn because A-frame uses 3D model shapes. Another thing that was hard, was trying to plan out in how I wanted my website to look like because my wireframe and my product look very different because I ended up changing in how I wanted my website to look.</p>
            <p>I wish that I would have spent more time working on my A-frame because I only use a-text instead making a 3D model. If I had a second chance I would want to make a 3D model of one of my future technologies that I came up with.</p>
            <p>Making this website was really fun and it made me pratice my skills even more as well learning new skills.</p>
